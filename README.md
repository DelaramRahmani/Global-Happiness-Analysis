# Global Happiness Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores the factors influencing global happiness using statistical modeling, regression analysis, and geospatial visualization. The objective is to identify key drivers of happiness and present the findings in an interactive Tableau Storyboard.

By leveraging Python and Tableau, this analysis uncovers patterns in happiness scores, GDP per capita, social support, life expectancy, and other influential variables. The study provides data-driven recommendations for policymakers and stakeholders to improve well-being across different regions.

## Key Analyses and Insights

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Assessed overall trends in global happiness from the World Happiness Report.
- Visualized key variables such as GDP per capita, life expectancy, and social support.

### 2. Regression Analysis
- Applied linear regression models to determine the strongest predictors of happiness.
- Examined the correlation between economic indicators and happiness scores.

### 3. Geospatial Analysis
- Created a Choropleth map to visualize happiness scores across continents.
- Identified regional disparities in happiness and economic conditions.

### 4. Final Recommendations
- Derived data-driven insights for policymakers to improve national happiness scores.
- Suggested strategies for enhancing economic growth, social well-being, and mental health policies.
